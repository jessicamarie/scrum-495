3-20-17: Description of Folders:

* apk: Contains an apk file of the app so you can download this file directly onto your android device to open the app without using AndroidStudio. I will try to update this file everytime I add changes to the app.

* screenshots: Contains screenshots of the app. I will try to upload screenshots of the apps progress by using a new folder each time.

* ScrumKickoff: This folder is the AndroidStudio project used to creat this app.
